# Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (egghead.io)

This project is based on the free (and rather involved) [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) course [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/).

## Installation
Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. Navigate to the folder that you/was created. Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. Finally, run `npm start` to launch to the project.

## Description
The course continues from where the first part, [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), left off.If you are not already experienced with Redux I suggest you start with the first part.

After the end of the course I styled the project with [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/), a react implementation of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
